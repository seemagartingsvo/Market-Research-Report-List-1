<p><h1>Thermal Enhanced Oil Recovery Market Size Growing and Forecasted for period from 2024 - 2031 and provides complete market analysis of this market</h1></p><p><strong>Thermal Enhanced Oil Recovery Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Thermal Enhanced Oil Recovery (TEOR) is a technique utilized to increase the extraction of crude oil from reservoirs that are difficult to access using conventional methods. By applying heat through steam injection or other heating techniques, TEOR reduces the viscosity of heavy crude oil, allowing it to flow more freely to the surface. This approach is particularly effective in augmenting production from heavy oil fields and is increasingly adopted as oil demand continues to rise.</p><p>The Thermal Enhanced Oil Recovery Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11% during the forecast period, driven by the need for efficient oil recovery methods amidst declining production from mature fields. Factors contributing to this growth include technological advancements in steam generation and injection processes, as well as rising investments in unconventional oil resources. Countries with large reserves of heavy oil, particularly in North America and the Middle East, are driving the market. Additionally, increasing environmental awareness is leading to innovations focused on reducing the carbon footprint associated with thermal methods. Latest trends also indicate a growing emphasis on integrating renewable energy sources into TEOR processes, enhancing overall sustainability in oil extraction.</p></p>
